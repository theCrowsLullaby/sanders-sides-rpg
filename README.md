# sanders-sides-rpg

this is a demo wersion of the roaring 20's visual novel. For now it's code heavy but it's open source. I might change the code side so it's a bit easier to access. For now if you want to try out parts of the story all you have to do is:

1:Chose the folder you want to have the story in.\n
2:Copy the path and open Command prompt on yout PC
3.wrtie: cd the_full_path_that_you_copied 
4.hit enter
5.write: npx create-react-app tss-rpg
6.after it downloads all necessary files write: cd tss-rpg
7.download the src file from this repository and interchange it with the existing src file in your tss-rpg folder
8.go back to your command prompt and write npm start
9.The game will load and you can start playing
